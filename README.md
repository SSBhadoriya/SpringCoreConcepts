# SpringCoreConcepts
A Spring core project focuses on : Coupling Concepts (Tight &amp; Loose Coupling).
Manual configuration and automat configuration of code using Spring IoC Annotations:
  -@Component
  -@Controller
  -@Bean
  -@Configuration
We've seen three types of Dependency Injections: Property (Field) Injection, Constructor based injection and Setter based injection.
Also used @Primary and @Qualifier annotations, in order to avoid ambiguity issue on Bean classes.
